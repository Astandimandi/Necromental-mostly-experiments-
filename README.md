# Necromental

Necromental is an incremental game where you're a necromancer trying to raise the perfect body. Of course it will take an army, descending into hell, adopting a dog, and other things to get there.
Built in python with TKInter library, but the code got complex so I switched to Dearpygui. 


**IMPORTANT:**  
I’m still setting up the repo and most builds might not launch clean, but the code is readable and functional (enough, at least you can see my angle). 
I’m working through the documentation for Dearpy so new update soon?

## Features (for now)
- Digging system with randomized resource drops, depending on your tools
- Crafting system with recipe logic
- Equipment toggles (shovel, knife, bucket)
- Auto-clicker for idle progression (for testing purposes, but will be purchaseable later)
- UI updates are dynamic, triggered by specific game state(s)

### Will be adding:
- Raise skeletons
- initial management and research
- research table
- Magic system (the bare bones of it)

#### Feedback
I'm not accepting pull requests atm because I don't think it makes a lot of sense right now, but I'm more than open to feedback/comments/tips/whatever. 
Let me know what you think if you stumble on this, i'll be adding new editions/scripts as time goes on.
